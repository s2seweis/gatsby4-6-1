Whisk together until well blended.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In a separate saucepan, make the caramel syrup. Heat the sugar and water over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar has melted and turned into a golden caramel color. Be careful as the caramel will be very hot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Quickly pour the caramel syrup into the bottom of individual llanera molds or a large baking dish, spreading it evenly to coat the bottom. The caramel will harden as it cools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pour the egg yolk mixture into the molds or baking dish with caramel, filling them about 3/4 full.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cover the molds or baking dish with aluminum foil.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Place the molds or baking dish in a larger baking pan or dish. Fill the larger pan with hot water, about halfway up the sides of the molds or baking dish. This water bath helps the leche flan cook gently and evenly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Carefully transfer the pans to the preheated oven and bake for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the leche flan is set. You can check if it's done by inserting a toothpick into the center of the flan; if it comes out clean, it's ready.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once cooked, remove the leche flan from the oven and let it cool to room temperature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once cooled, refrigerate the leche flan for at least a few hours or overnight to allow it to fully set and chill.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To serve, run a knife along the edges of the mold to loosen the leche flan. Place a serving plate on top of the mold and invert it to release the leche flan, allowing the caramel to drizzle over the top.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Slice and serve the creamy and caramel-infused Leche Flan as a delightful Filipino dessert.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Enjoy your delicious Leche Flan!</p>"}}}}],"cover":null,"youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YIsEYluQaLk"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"leche-flan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["970175933"]}
