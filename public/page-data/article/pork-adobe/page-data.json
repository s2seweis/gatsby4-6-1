Mix well to make the marinade.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the pork cubes to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour in the refrigerator, or even overnight for deeper flavors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove the pork pieces from the marinade, reserving the marinade for later use. Add the pork to the hot skillet and sear on all sides until browned. This step helps develop the flavors and texture of the pork.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the pork is browned, pour the marinade and water into the skillet. Bring it to a boil.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the pork simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pork is tender. Stir occasionally and add more water if needed to prevent the pork from drying out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the pork is tender, you can adjust the seasoning by adding salt to taste. The soy sauce already provides saltiness, so adjust according to your preference.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continue simmering for another 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Serve the Pork Adobo hot with steamed rice. The rich sauce can be drizzled over the rice for added flavor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enjoy your delicious Pork Adobo!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: Adobo is known to taste even better when reheated the next day as the flavors continue to develop. Feel free to make it in advance and enjoy it as leftovers.</p>"}}}}],"cover":null,"youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YIsEYluQaLk"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pork-adobe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["970175933"]}
