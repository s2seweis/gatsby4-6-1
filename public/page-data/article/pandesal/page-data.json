Mix well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the warm milk. Add the vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and eggs. Mix the wet ingredients together in the well, then gradually incorporate the dry ingredients until a sticky dough forms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transfer the dough onto a clean, lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a little more flour, but be careful not to add too much.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Allow it to rise in a warm place for about 1 to 2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the dough has risen, gently punch it down to release any air bubbles. Transfer it back to the floured surface and divide it into smaller portions. You can shape them into round rolls or flatten them slightly for a more traditional pandesal shape.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Roll each portion in breadcrumbs to coat the exterior, then place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Leave some space between each roll to allow for rising.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cover the rolls with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rise for another 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until they double in size.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) during the last 10 minutes of the rising time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until they turn golden brown.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove the pandesal from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack. Serve them warm or at room temperature.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Enjoy your freshly baked pandesal! They're delicious on their own or with butter, jam, or your favorite spread.</p>"}}}}],"cover":{"alternativeText":null,"localFile":{"url":"https://food-blog-v001-image-bucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Pandesal_00bea90275.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ef68c50beb24f6653d0e234ca0e7865f/0d27e/Pandesal_00bea90275.webp","srcSet":"/static/ef68c50beb24f6653d0e234ca0e7865f/b5535/Pandesal_00bea90275.webp 200w,\n/static/ef68c50beb24f6653d0e234ca0e7865f/f5c71/Pandesal_00bea90275.webp 400w,\n/static/ef68c50beb24f6653d0e234ca0e7865f/0d27e/Pandesal_00bea90275.webp 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":800,"height":600}}}},"youtube":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pandesal"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1412739535","1536068349","1648984648","2020735422","2229396044","2247589047","2950925519","3252330687","3349709517","344402463","3826442813","685474715","747543326","834010452","907658900","960431041","970175933"]}
